# Testing

## BDD
Behaviour Driven Development
The topic of BDD covers the entire life cycle of the app development process, from planning the project to writing the code. 

BDD encourages you to specify the behaviour of the app in term of user stories which are broken down into scenarios that can be built and tested. 

We will focus on testing with BDD frameworkds today. 


## BDD Frameworks
When we write tests, we are testing the behaviour of our code. Every tests involves setting up some data, running some code that should do something, and asserting that it does that thing. 

## Setting up
We first need to install a testing framework to start testing our Javascript code. 
We will be using the `mocha` testing frameworka dn teh `chai` assertion library.
